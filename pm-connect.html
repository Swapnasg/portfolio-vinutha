                <p>In every corporate environment, managing day-to-day activities and keeping track of workflows can
                    often feel scattered and time-consuming. To address this, we built EMAAR PM Connect, an in-house

                        <p>Before PM Connect, daily operations were manual and scattered—employees faced delays, admins
                            spent hours on repetitive tasks, and management
                            lacked real-time visibility. This led to inefficiency, silos, and slower decisions across
                            the organisation.</p>

                        slow manual work, scattered tracking, and lack of visibility inspired us to build a platform

                        admins tracking workflows, and leadership seeking visibility—each had a unique story. By
                        stepping into their shoes, we shaped solutions that feel natural, supportive, and easy for

                    <h3>Interviews:</h3>
                    <p>When we started building PM Connect, I didn’t begin with software—I began with stories. I wanted
                        to understand how people actually work—not just how they should work. I talked to project
                        managers, teams, and leaders about their daily challenges. What I heard shaped everything—PM
                        Connect became a smart, connected space where AI and human insight meet to make work simpler,
                        clearer, and more connected.</p>

                            review and approve the project. A simple “Add Assignees” field lets me search and add team
                            members, while the list below displays each approver’s name, email, and avatar. Currently, I

                            with an option to remove anyone using the red Remove button. Once the list looks right, I
