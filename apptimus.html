                            without the morning scramble, how to welcome guests with zero fuss, or how to make sure
                            meeting rooms don’t turn into battle zones. My role was to bring these moments together in a
                            way that feels effortless and cheerful for users. I focused on creating simple, friendly
                            designs that make the app feel less like a tool and more like a helpful buddy at work—always
                            there to keep things smooth and stress-free.</p>

                    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                    <p>While designing Apptimus, I connected with employees, managers, and facility teams to learn their
                        everyday struggles—from desk hunts to meeting room clashes. These insights helped me craft

                        employees hunting for desks, to managers juggling teams, to facility staff keeping things
                        running, and admins overseeing it all—everyone had their own story. By stepping into their
                        shoes, we could design solutions that felt natural, helpful, and easy for each of them.</p>

                        <h3>Booking a Desk with Amenities</h3>
                        <p>Imagine an employee starting their day with Apptimus. Instead of walking around the office
                            searching for a free desk, they simply open the app.
                            They begin by choosing the date and time they’ll be in the office. With flexible options for
                            duration or shift, they can easily match their booking to their work schedule. <br>Next
                            comes personalisation. Employees can select amenities – whether it’s a dual monitor for
                            design tasks, an ergonomic chair for comfort, or proximity to charging points. This ensures
                            their desk is not just available, but also tailored to their needs.
                            <br>Moving to the interactive floor map, they see a clear visual of available, occupied, and
                            selected desks. A single tap secures their preferred spot.
                            Finally, the app confirms the booking with all details neatly summarised – desk number,
                            location, time, and chosen amenities – giving the employee confidence that everything is
                            ready when they arrive.
                            <br>With Apptimus, booking a desk isn’t just about finding a seat – it’s about creating the
                            right workspace, effortlessly.

                            moments—like a shared laugh on a local train or a quiet evening in a crowded park. While the
                            noise may never fade, it’s in this hustle that urban life finds its rhythm.</p>
