                        <p>Designing Bandobast wasn’t just about pixels—it was about people. I stepped into the shoes of
                            the commissioner department, asking how they managed duties, what slowed them down, and what
                            they truly needed. Those conversations shaped every decision. I bridged the gap between the
                            field and the tech team, translating real-world challenges into clear, intuitive screens.
                            Side by side with our developer and team lead, we iterated, refined, and made sure every
                            screen wasn’t just functional—but meaningful.</p>

                        <h3>Assign Duty</h3>
                        <p>In the Bandobast app, once an event is created and reviewed, higher-ranking officers such as
                            Inspectors or senior officers are responsible for assigning specific roles and
                            responsibilities to the police force.
                            This process ensures that every officer knows where to be, when to report, and what task to
                            perform during the event.</p>

                        <p>Life in a fast-growing city often feels like a blend of chaos and charm. From early morning
                            traffic to late-night chai stalls, every corner tells a story. people from different
                            backgrounds come together, not just to work and commute, but to build dreams in small
                            moments—like a shared laugh on a local train or a quiet evening in a crowded park. While the
                            noise may never fade, it’s in this hustle that urban life finds its rhythm.</p>
