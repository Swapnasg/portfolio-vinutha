                        <p>Every journey starts with a struggle—and everyone here felt it. Teachers had no easy way to
                            track students. HODs were stuck with too many files.
                            Coordinators were tired of jumping between tools. Principals wanted one clear view but got
                            bits and pieces. And students just wanted learning to
                            make sense. So we asked—what’s going wrong, what’s missing, and how do we fix it? That’s
                            where the real change began</p>

                        <p>When I worked on InPulse, I wasn’t just designing an app—I was building a bridge between
                            everyone on campus. On one side, I spoke with teachers, HODs, and admins to dig into their
                            real struggles—like tracking student progress or juggling accreditation tasks. On the other
                            side, I listened to students, who had their own needs—more playful, more engaging ways to
                            learn and grow. I took all these voices, mixed them into ideas, and worked with our
                            developer and team lead to bring them to life as simple, friendly screens. We tested,
                            tweaked, and fine-tuned until InPulse felt like a tool that worked for everyone—helping
                            faculty stay organised and helping students discover and grow their own superpowers</p>

                    <h2>Initial Research</h2>
                    <p>While building the InPulse web app, I went on a campus-wide adventure—chatting with everyone from
                        instructors, HODs, and coordinators to the principal, dean, and even the admissions, finance,
                        and placement teams. I also sat down with students to hear about their day-to-day wins and woes.
                        Each conversation revealed little secrets—how people work, where they struggle, and what would
                        make their lives easier. These stories became my treasure map, guiding me to design a web app
                        that feels natural for everyone, whether you’re an admin juggling approvals or a student chasing
                        deadlines.</p>

                        different types of users across the institution. Understanding the roles of instructors, HODs,
                        coordinators, department heads, and students helped us map their specific needs and design

                    <h3>Interviews:</h3>
                    <p>When we started building the InPulse web app, I didn’t just sit behind a desk—I went straight to
                        the source. I sat with instructors between classes, caught HODs in their busy corridors, chatted
                        with department heads over coffee, and listened to students in their favorite hangout spots. I
                        wanted the unfiltered version of their day—what flows, what frustrates, and what could be
                        better. Those stories, small struggles, and big ideas became the blueprint for a system that
                        doesn’t just “work,” but feels like it was made for them—making academics smoother, admin
                        lighter, and student journeys clearer.</p>

                            Mapping, all of that happens on a single screen. Faculty can directly link COs with POs,
                            align competencies and indicators, and generate structured mappings in minutes. This cuts
                            down 90% of paperwork, reduces errors, and frees them to focus on teaching instead of
                            tables. InPulse didn’t just digitize paperwork; it reimagined academic planning into a
                            smarter, faster, and stress-free process.</p>

                                out the full academic blueprint—NBA course codes, categories, titles, teaching hours
                                (theory/tutorial/practical/SDA), exam pattern (duration, CIE/SEE marks), and

                                source of truth: coordinators and instructors are auto-notified, their next steps
                                unlock, and downstream screens (lesson plans, CO-PO mapping, timetables, reports) are
                                prefilled and consistent. No more Excel ping-pong, duplicate entries, or version
                                confusion—just role-based control, audit-ready accuracy, and a department that moves in
                                sync.</p>

                            need to work on. The platform then recommends personalized courses to bridge those gaps,
